title2: About the organizers
text2: The Netherlands eScience Center is a research organization that since 2012 has been uniquely positioned as an independent foundation, financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and the Dutch organization for IT in education and research (SURF). It is the national centre with the digital skills to create innovative software solutions in academic software. The core activities of the eScience Center are carried out by Research Software Engineers (RSEs) who are high-end, university-level specialists who do two things: they do research using digital technologies and methodologies, and they engineer software. The Research Software Alliance (ReSA) is an international community of professionals whose mission is to “bring research software communities together to collaborate on the advancement of the research software ecosystem.” Together, they ensure that “research software and those who develop and maintain it are recognized and valued as fundamental and vital to research worldwide.”
